# Test for Applicants

## Instructions from Alexey Serbskiy

1. install Python 3.7.3 https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. download project from gitHub 
3. open terminal and navigate to the a project folder
3. run bash script testTask.sh via command "bash testTask.sh", it should install all needed packages and run tests.


## Context

As a QA in an Agile team, you’re part of a team developing a new cool feature, which mainly comprises a front-end application and a REST API. 
As so you must ensure all front-end API dependent operations respond successfully, according to the business rules and any unwanted changes are detected prior to the production environment. 

With this in mind your team needs to ensure that on each API deploy you have no fallbacks and REST operations are according the architecture. 
Having this in mind you’ll prototype a proof-of-concept to the CTO so he understands how important this is.

## Story

Please build a project that ensures a rigid testing plan of the following REQRES API: **[https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/).**

You’ll find the REST operations permitted in the link provided. Exploit the greater coverage as possible with all possible scenarios in mind. 

## Requirements

Feel free to adopt the best technologies you find suitable for the end goal. Still we need to impose the following requirements:

1. Please use git as a version control system. Make sure that you have clear commit messages and understandable steps in your git-history ([How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
2. Document your work.
3. Provide a README and instructions for how we can run your solution. **Note** It should be runnable with one command.
4. Respect modularity and scalable solution for further test suites.
