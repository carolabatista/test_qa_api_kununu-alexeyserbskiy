# Test for Applicants

## Context

As a QA in an Agile team, you’re part of a team developing a new cool feature, which mainly comprises a front-end application and a REST API. 
As so you must ensure all front-end API dependent operations respond successfully, according to the business rules and any unwanted changes are detected prior to the production environment. 

With this in mind your team needs to ensure that on each API deploy you have no fallbacks and REST operations are according the architecture. 
Having this in mind you’ll prototype a proof-of-concept to the CTO so he understands how important this is.

## Story

Please build a project that ensures a rigid testing plan of the following REQRES API: **[https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/).**

You’ll find the REST operations permitted in the link provided. Exploit the greater coverage as possible with all possible scenarios in mind.
